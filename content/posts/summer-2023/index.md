I'm not the biggest fan of Swedish summers, with the sun shining relentlessly day and night. The constant brightness can make it hard to find a moment of peace in my mind. However, this year, I challenged myself to make the most of the summer by trying out different activities.

### Going SUP (Stand-Up Paddle) at the Lake
I must admit, I fell in love with paddleboarding at the lake. Whether sitting or standing on the board, the gentle rocking motion caused by the waves and the soothing sound of the paddle slicing into the water had a truly relaxing effect on me. At one point, I even had grand plans of paddling from Leggesta all the way along the lakes and rivers to Trosa. However, I quickly realized that even the slightest wave can make forward progress quite challenging. It's still on my wish list, but before I attempt that journey, I know I need to hone my skills through more training.

### Bouldering 
I tried bouldering for the first time in my life. I'm pretty skilled when it comes to sports with rackets, but this was a different challenge. My best achievement so far has been solving puzzles at the 4+ level. It was enjoyable both to try solving puzzles myself and to watch how other people tackled the problems. However, my arms got extremely painful afterward, and the discomfort persisted for at least a week.

### Picking Fresh Strawberries
My friend and I picked two kilograms of strawberries from a farm. It was worth it, as they only cost 45 kronor per kilogram compared to the 125 kronor per kilogram at the supermarket. Most of the strawberries we picked were sweet. However, there was a surprising moment when I reached for a strawberry and unexpectedly touched a tiny black worm. I made a startled sound and quickly threw it away.

### Picking Wild Mushrooms
I ventured into the forests with friends and colleagues, exploring off-the-beaten-path areas and enduring the relentless mosquito presence – a common annoyance during this season in Sweden. Despite the pesky insects, the forest expedition was rewarding. We encountered various types of mushrooms, including "stort haröra" (hare's ear), a mushroom that releases smoke when you squeeze it, which was particularly fascinating. Moreover, one of my colleagues imparted a valuable lesson on differentiating edible from non-edible mushrooms. Fortunately, our efforts were rewarded as we found some "kantareller" (chanterelles) and "blomkålsvamp" (cauliflower mushroom) to bring back home.

### Camping in Kolmården
Kolmården is one of my favorite places in Sweden, mainly because of the breathtaking view overlooking Bråviken (a bay of Baltic Sea). I was truly amazed during my first visit, and I hope to return one day. This time, I camped in an area surrounded by trees and within walking distance of the water. It was cozy to sit in the forest and enjoy a warm meal at the same time. The following morning, I embarked on a two-hour hike to a spot called 'Spiran' at the top of a hill, from where I could see tiny houses, the ocean, and ferries below me. It was a truly impressive sight.

### Visiting Poland
I spent a total of six days in Gdansk and Warsaw. Unfortunately, the weather was gloomy with constant rain, limiting my view of the cities. During my visit, I explored several museums, including the Museum of the Second World War, Muzeum Poczty Polskiej w Gdańsk (Polish Postal Museum in Gdańsk), and the Maria Skłodowska-Curie Museum. Many of these museums in Poland focus on wartime history. Despite having read books and watched movies about World War Two, it was still a somber experience to witness the real-life remnants and memorials. Additionally, I had the opportunity to visit a church where Chapino's heart was buried. The serene atmosphere in that church left me with a profound sense of peace.

One of the best parts of my trip was trying the local food. I loved dishes like "Pierogi" (Polish dumpling), sour rye soup with a boiled egg, and pork knuckle - they were really tasty. I even liked Polish pork knuckle more than the ones in Germany. People had told me to try the renowned roasted duck with apples, but I couldn't find a restaurant that served it.

A memorable experience occurred while taking the train from Gdansk to Warsaw, as they gave out free bottles of water, allowing passengers to choose between sparkling and still water.

I won't say I've grown to love Swedish summer, but at least I now have cherished memories to hold onto. I'm eagerly awaiting the arrival of my favorite season, autumn.
